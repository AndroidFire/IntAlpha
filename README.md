 A alogrthim for encrypting and decrypting text by key using numbers.


# Description:

 A text can be converted to no. like 1-4564-43 and it have to unlock by a key that is inside the no.
 generally when plain text and key is placed on this algos text get converted to no [for ' ' = 1 , '1' = 2 on and on]
 and appending '-' after each no. In key converting to no is different as compared with plain text it just mutiplied the
 no on character '-'. Then again no. text is split by -  and each no is multiplied by key again we repack it and we get
 brand new no. on decrypting it's just opposite
